~intro
## Introduction

Robo Dojo is a clone of the 1998 game [RoboCom](http://robocom.rrobek.de/).
You play the game by programming bots to battle each other with home-brewed
viruses.

Here's a [screenshot](##4way) of a four-way battle.

Throughout the rest of this document, I assume you are a savvy programmer.

- Each tear-drop shape is a different bot
- If a bot contains a circle of a different color, that means the bot
  is infected
- If a bot has a white line through it, that means the bot is deactivated
