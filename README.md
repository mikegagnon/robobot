## About
Robo Dojo is a simple virus-programming game. 

To begin the game, two bots are randomly placed on a 16 × 16 board — one bot is loaded with your program, the other is loaded with your opponent’s program.

When you press the play button, the bots begin executing — moving, turning, looking, multiplying, infecting, disinfecting, crashing, emergent phenomena arising …

You are declared the victor once all your opponent’s bots have crashed.

The game is simple: there are only 12 instructions and only a handful of concepts. The game is also complex: it is challenging to craft winning programs.

The game is not solved. Is it possible to develop a program that defeats all other programs? Does every strategy & tactic imply an effective counter?
